Q:What is Encapsulation?
Encapsulation is an OOPS concept to create and define the permissions 
and restrictions of an object and its member variables and methods. 

A very simple example to explain the concept is to make the 
member variables of a class private and providing public getter and setter 
methods. 

Java provides four types of access level modifiers:
public, protected, no modifier and private

Encapsulation is one of the four fundamental OOP concepts. 
The other three are inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

Encapsulation in Java is a mechanism of wrapping the data 
(variables) and code acting on the data (methods) 
together as a single unit. 

In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden 
from other classes, and can be accessed only through the 
methods of their current class. 
Therefore, it is also known as data hiding.

To achieve encapsulation in Java :
Declare the variables of a class as private.

Provide public setter and getter methods 
to modify and view the variables values.
